A C++ library for studying the bicycle.  Includes programs for:
    - numerical simulation of nonlinear equations of motion
    - eigenvalues of linearized upright zero-steer dynamics as function of speed
    - generation of numerous level curve plots in the lean-steer plane
    - Python code to plot all results and save the data
