OBD:  Open Bicycle Dynamics
===========================

A C++ library for studying the bicycle.  Includes programs for:
    - numerical simulation of nonlinear equations of motion
    - eigenvalues of linearized upright steady dynamics as function of speed
    - Python code to plot all results and save the data

0. Download
-----------
The current release is available here :

http://www.dlpeterson.com/OBD/

The development source code is hosted on github.com :

$ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/OBD.git

To build from the development source, you will need Autotools installed.  After
cloning, run :

$ autoreconf -i

And then proceed with the standard configure and make process.

1. Required libraries
---------------------

To build the source, you must be able to link to the following libaries:

libgsl    -- GNU Scientific Library


2. Building
-----------
To configure and build, we recommend a separate build directory :

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure && make
    $ sudo make install

4. Getting help
---------------

Each of the executables generated by make support several command line options.
To see what options are supported, do:

    $ ./whippleeig --help


5. Plotting examples
--------------------

For the Whipple model, several standard plots are available: eigenvalue vs.
speed plots, time series simulation plots, and steady turning plots.  All of
these are controlled from the Python script 'plot.py'.  All simulation inputs
and outputs are saved to a tar.bz2 file and stored in results folder so you
don't overwrite simulation results.

$ python plot.py
