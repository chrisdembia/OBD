OBD:  Open Bicycle Dynamics
===========================

A C++ library for studying the bicycle.  Includes programs for:
    - numerical simulation of nonlinear equations of motion
    - eigenvalues of linearized upright steady dynamics as function of speed
    - Python code to plot all results and save the data

0. Download
-----------
The current release is available here :

http://www.dlpeterson.com/OBD/

The development source code is hosted on github.com :

$ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/OBD.git

1. Required libraries
---------------------

To build the source, you must be able to link to the following libaries:

libgsl    -- GNU Scientific Library
libcblas  -- C Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem
libatlas  -- Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software


2. Building
-----------
OBD uses GNU Autoconf 2.67 for its build system.  To build and install, type :

    $ make

3. Clean
--------

To clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the repository):

    $ ./make clean

4. Getting help
---------------

Each of the executables generated by make support several command line options.
To see what options are supported, do:

    $ ./simulate --help


5. Running examples
----------------------------

The make file has 2 examples currently, a simple numerical integration, as well
as an animation.  To build the simulation:

    $ ./make simulate

then to run it:

    $ ./simulate

To build the simulation with the animation:

    $ ./make animation

then to run it:

    $ ./bikeanimation
