OBD:  Open Bicycle Dynamics
===========================

A C++ library for studying the bicycle.  Includes programs for:
    - numerical simulation of nonlinear equations of motion
    - eigenvalues of linearized upright zero-steer dynamics as function of speed
    - generation of numerous level curve plots in the lean-steer plane
    - Python code to plot all results and save the data

The current release is available here:

http://www.dlpeterson.com/OBD/

The development source code is hosted on github.com.  To build from the
development source, you will need cmake installed.  Out of source builds are
the only supported approach to building.  Here is how to clone the source code
and build it:

    $ git clone git://github.com/hazelnusse/OBD.git
    $ mkdir OBD-build
    $ cd OBD-build
    $ cmake ../OBD-build
    $ make

cmake also supports a graphical configuration, use cmake-gui instead of cmake.
This allows you to see the various build options that exist.

1. Required libraries
---------------------
To build the source, you must be able to link to the following libaries:

GSL    -- GNU Scientific Library, provides ODE and root finding support
Qt     -- Nokia's GUI framework
Eigen  -- C++ linear algebra library

2. Getting help
---------------
Each of the executables generated by make support several command line options.
To see what options are supported, do:

    $ ./whippleeig --help

Currently, looking at the source is the form of best documentation, Doxygen
should be coming soon.

3. Running tests
----------------
After running cmake (or cmake-gui), type:

    $ make test

4. Building Documentation
-------------------------
If you have Doxygen installed, you can build html and LaTeX documentation by
typing:

    $ make doc

The resulting documentation will be in the doc/ folder
