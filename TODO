-- get python plotting library installed a proper location
-- Add animation code

-- GUI work (last revised 110726 by chris):

    -- general
        -- win32 build
        -- win64 build
        -- thread management (mandlebrot example)
        -- database storage/ file IO, PostgreSQL
        -- update to work with new Gryostat whipple structure
        -- documentation
        -- good usage instructions IN the program (tooltips)
        -- eliminate most header files; use forward declaration
        -- cannot have zero bikes? prevent deleting bike1
    -- parameters
        -- make a separate window
        -- multiple bikes
        -- franke parameters
        -- remove parameters e.g. v, g
        -- draw a bike in 2D (lines and mass centres)
        -- selector for which bikes show up in the upright eig plot
        -- tooltip to explain what all the parameters are
        -- error management if user attempts to have two bicycles with the same
        name
        -- if a bike has only gswp params defined, looking at the meij tab will
        erase the gswp parameters
                -- particularly relevant when switching bikes
        -- make static the string names (put in cpp file): tried this; issues
        with private and type
        -- make qlistview uneditable (can't change names of bikes)
        -- "convert meij to gyro params" not implemented
        -- make sure that qlineedit is being set properly when changing bikes
        -- fix memory issue of deleting a bike from the vector
        -- save qdrawing
        -- TDO 0810: CLEAN UP EIGENVALUE PLOT, TALK TO THE MAN, LISTEN TO
        VOICEMAIL!
        -- create checkboxes to select which bikes are used in which tabs
    -- upright stability
        -- list of roots/intersections (bifurcation speed) (Meij.2007)
        -- draw vertical lines on the eigplot at intersections
        -- save image, investigate gl2ps
        XX save data
        -- reset view; plot keeps overlapping on update! 
        -- help tooltip to show interactor keys
        -- USE JASON'S SORTING ALGORITHM
        -- OR USE DOTS INSTEAD OF LINES, NEGATE THE NEG UNREAL TO BE POS
        -- get rid of "pitch guess", preferred to have two options: upright
        bike and upsidedown bike
        -- the code i added into myqwhipple to make upright stability causes an
        exception to be thrown when deleting the LAST BIKE; can delete non-last
        bikes just fine. i think it's because vtkchart is hooked up to the
        table that is a member of the myqwhipple
    -- steady turning
        -- precisely determine range of pitch variable; solve for lean pitch is zero, get both
        -- solutions; 
        -- default level curves color table
    -- simulation
        -- plot update
        -- data to txt file
        -- draw force vectors
        -- display multiple bikes in popup windows
        -- input forcing
        -- line/wheel trace
        -- video output (save to vid)
        -- finish interface
            -- save images
            -- force input
            -- save data
            -- video controls (rewind)
        -- text annotation on video
        -- multiple camera angles
        -- shift transformations from rot steps to a single 4x4 matrix push
        -- crash detection, using tire forces: lateral to normal force ratio)
        -- text showing x,y distance traveled, show 10m lines on the "ground"    
        -- prevent segfault when bike falls over, or when there are too many samples

-- Conventions
    -- space after comma
    -- two space indents
    -- order
    -- header files arrange
    -- limit includes: someone else using my class
    -- member variable vtk objects; how often are they used?
    -- } // for i, if
    -- move pointer to the right

-- tdo 0814
    -- make simulation speak multiple bikes
